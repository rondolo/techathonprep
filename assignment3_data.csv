https://wikidata.summary.nl/JenniferDoudna,Jennifer Doudna,"Jennifer Anne Doudna  ( born February 19  1964) is an American biochemist who has done pioneering work in CRISPR gene editing  and made other fundamental contributions in biochemistry and genetics. Doudna was one of the first women to share a Nobel in the sciences. She received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry  with Emmanuelle Charpentier  ""for the development of a method for genome editing."" She is the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California  Berkeley. She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997. She graduated from Pomona College in 1985 and earned a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1989. Apart from her professorship at Berkeley  she is also president and chair of the board of the Innovative Genomics Institute  a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes  and an adjunct professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California  San Francisco (UCSF). In 2012  Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes  which has been called one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology. Since then  Doudna has been a leading figure in what is referred to as the ""CRISPR revolution"" for her fundamental work and leadership in developing CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Her many other prestigious awards and fellowships include the 2000 Alan T. Waterman Award for her research on the structure as determined by X-ray crystallography of a ribozyme  and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology  with Charpentier. She has been a co-recipient of the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2015)  the Tang Prize (2016)  the Canada Gairdner International Award (2016)  and the Japan Prize (2017). She was  named one of the Time 100 most influential people in 2015.
https://wikidata.summary.nl/RachelCarson,Rachel Carson,"Rachel Louise Carson (May 27  1907 � April 14  1964) was an American marine biologist  writer  and conservationist whose influential book Silent Spring (1962) and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement. Carson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries  and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book Award  recognition as a gifted writer and financial security. Her next book  The Edge of the Sea  and the reissued version of her first book  Under the Sea Wind  were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths. Late in the 1950s  Carson turned her attention to conservation  especially some problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962)  which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies  it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy  which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter."
https://wikidata.summary.nl/RosalindFranklin,Rosalind Franklin,"Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 1920 � 16 April 1958) was a British  chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)  RNA (ribonucleic acid)  viruses  coal  and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime  her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life  for which she has been variously referred to as the ""wronged heroine""  the ""dark lady of DNA""  the ""forgotten heroine""  a ""feminist icon""  and the ""Sylvia Plath of molecular biology"".She graduated in 1941 with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College  Cambridge  and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish  the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. Disappointed by Norrish's lack of enthusiasm  she took up a research position under the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942. The research on coal helped her earn a PhD from Cambridge in 1945. Moving to Paris in 1947 as a chercheur (postdoctoral researcher) under Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'�tat  she became an accomplished X-ray crystallographer. After joining King's College London in 1951 as a research associate  she discovered the key properties of DNA  which eventually facilitated the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA. Owing to disagreement with her director  John Randall  and her colleague Maurice Wilkins  she was compelled to move to Birkbeck College in 1953."
https://wikidata.summary.nl/GertrudeElion,Gertrude Elion,"Gertrude ""Trudy"" Belle Elion (January 23  1918 � February 21  1999) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist  who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs. This new method focused on understanding the target of the drug rather than simply using trial-and-error. Her work led to the creation of the anti-retroviral drug AZT  which was the first drug widely used against AIDS. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug  azathioprine  used to fight rejection in organ transplants  and the first successful antiviral drug  acyclovir (ACV)  used in the treatment of herpes infection."
https://wikidata.summary.nl/RitaLeviMontalcini,Rita Levi-Montalcini,Rita Levi-Montalcini (22 April 1909 � 30 December 2012) was an Italian Nobel laureate  honored for her work in neurobiology. She was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with colleague Stanley Cohen for the discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF).From 2001 until her death  she also served in the Italian Senate as a Senator for Life. This honor was given due to her significant scientific contributions. On 22 April 2009  she became the first Nobel laureate to reach the age of 100  and the event was feted with a party at Rome's City Hall.
